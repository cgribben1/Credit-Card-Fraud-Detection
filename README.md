# Credit Card Fraud Detection Using Several Machine Learning Models
It is important that credit card companies are able to recognize fraudulent credit card transactions so that customers are not charged for items that they did not purchase. 

In this project, I create and compare several different machine learning models in order to tackle the problem of credit fraud detection.

Machine learning models investigated:
- **Logistic Regression**

- **Tree-based Methods**
  - Simple Decision Tree
  - Pruned Decision Tree
  - Random Forest
  - XGBoost

- **Feedforward Neural Network**

The **full project report** is found in the **.ipynb** file included in this repo...
